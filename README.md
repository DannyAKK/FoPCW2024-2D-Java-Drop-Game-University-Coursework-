# FoPCW2024 – 2D Java Drop Game (University Coursework)

This project is a 2D Java game developed in NetBeans as part of the FoPCW2024 university module.
It demonstrates Java programming concepts including inheritance, event handling, a game loop, and custom graphics rendering using Swing and AWT.

The project uses the NetBeans Ant build system, with configuration stored in build.xml and the nbproject folder.

## Project Overview

The game creates a simple 2D environment where the player can move around a tile-based world and interact with a variety of objects such as walls, boxes, floors, items, droppers and doors.

It demonstrates the following concepts:

- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Sprite rendering  
- Real-time game loop  
- Keyboard input  
- Modular class design  
- Asset management in Java  
- NetBeans/Ant project structure

## Java Class Descriptions

Launcher.java  
Entry point of the entire game. Creates and initializes the game engine and GUI.

GameGUI.java  
Responsible for creating the game window and rendering graphics using Swing.

GameEngine.java  
Manages the main game loop, updates all entities, and handles frame timing and rendering.

Player.java  
Represents the player character. Stores movement, position, sprite, and updates based on input.

Entity.java  
Base class for all game objects. Used for shared features such as position and rendering.

Dropper.java  
Represents a falling or moving hazard object in the game.

Tile.java  
Represents static map tiles such as floors, walls, boxes, ceilings, etc.

InputHandler.java  
Handles keyboard input and updates player movement accordingly.

## How to Run the Project

### Option 1 — Run in NetBeans

1. Open NetBeans  
2. Click “Open Project”  
3. Select this project folder  
4. Press “Run Project”  

### Option 2 — Run using Ant (Command Line)

Requirements:  
- Java JDK 17 or higher  
- Apache Ant  

Steps:

1. Open a terminal inside the project folder  
2. Run:

ant run

## About build.xml

build.xml is the Ant build script automatically generated by NetBeans.  
It handles:

- Compiling classes  
- Cleaning the build directory  
- Running the project  
- Packaging the JAR file  

Users should not modify build.xml unless required.

## Notes

- All PNG sprite files must remain in the assets folder for the game to run correctly.  
- The project uses pure Java and does not require any external libraries.  
- The Ant and NetBeans configuration files should remain intact for proper building and running.
